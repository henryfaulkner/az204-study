## Study Materials

- I mostly read the material in the modules on the certification page itself
  - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/az-204/
- I also really liked the Microsoft Skills Challenge, though some topics are not relevant to the example anymore.

- This Youtube series was ok for passive learning but it didn't make as much of an impact
